# Jordan Rancie

Long-term developer and technology enthusiast with a background in Computer and Data Science.
My work focuses on how information systems can enable more advanced data sharing and deeper cooperation as we transition to an AI/AGI economy.

## Businesses

**[Datakey.ai](https://datakey.ai)** — Data and software consulting specialising in enterprise information architectures. Applied research into AI and graph systems.

**Econic.ai (coming soon)** — Open source infrastructure for collaborative intelligence. Our work sits at the intersection of data sovereignty, real-time collaboration, and information integrity — addressing the challenges of personalisation, collaboration, and trust as intelligence systems become central to how we work.


## Current Projects

**[Massive Graph](https://github.com/econic-ai/massive-graph)** — A real-time graph database designed for collaboration across zero-trust boundaries. Synchronises massive graphs, tensors, and streams between participants who need to share data but cannot fully trust each other. Delta propagation, zero-copy architecture, cryptographic lineage. Target applications include supply chain coordination, research intelligence clusters, and distributed infrastructure networks.

**[UX?UI 3D Graphs](https://github.com/econic-ai/graphs)** — A 3D graph engine for exploring graph structures at scale. When millions of data points change every second, this framework turns complexity into spatial, navigable environments with interactive HTML overlays on 3D positions.


## Research Interests

- **Collaborative neural architectures** — part neural networks, part software architecture
- **Intelligent markets** — where market analytics drive sustainable economics
- **Intelligent Feeds** — Applying data mining and AI inference to data streams
- **Multi-layered AI systems** — decoupling real-time inference from deeper structure-building
- **Spatial interfaces** for human-AI cooperation at massive scale
