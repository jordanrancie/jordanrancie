# Jordan Rancie

Founder of [Datakey](https://datakey.com.au) and [Econic](https://econic.ai). UNSW alumnus — Master of Data Science (2023).

I build infrastructure for collaborative intelligence systems. My work focuses on how information systems can enable deeper cooperation as we transition to an AI-driven economy.

## Businesses

**Datakey** — Data and software consulting specialising in enterprise information architectures. Applied research into AI and graph systems for clients.

**Econic** — Open source infrastructure for collaborative AI. Technologies at the intersection of data control, real-time collaboration, and information integrity.

## Current Projects

**[Massive Graph](https://github.com/econic-ai/massive-graph)** — A real-time graph-tensor database designed for collaborative intelligence in zero-trust environments. Delta propagation, zero-copy architecture, cryptographic integrity. Synchronises massive graphs, tensors, and information streams across distributed actors in real-time.

**[Econic Graphs](https://github.com/econic-ai/graphs)** — A 3D graph engine for interactively exploring graph structures at scale (billions of nodes). Framework for building UX/UIs that adapt based on underlying graph traversal.

## Research Interests

- Large-scale graph processing, temporal graphs, distributed graph engines
- Collaborative neural architectures — part neural networks, part software architecture
- Intelligent search and discovery across multiple coordinating models
- Game theory applied to information collaboration
- Intelligent markets and decentralised cross-industry AI systems
