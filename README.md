# Jordan Rancie

Founder of [Datakey](https://datakey.com.au) and [Econic](https://econic.ai). UNSW alumnus — Master of Data Science (2023).

Information is relationships. I build infrastructure for collaborative intelligence — systems where individuals and organisations can share data while maintaining control, as we shift to an economy powered by AI.

## Businesses

**Datakey** — Data and software consulting specialising in enterprise information architectures. Applied research into AI and graph systems.

**Econic** — Open source infrastructure for collaborative intelligence. Our work sits at the intersection of data sovereignty, real-time collaboration, and information integrity — addressing the challenges of personalisation, collaboration, and trust as intelligence systems become central to how we work.

## Current Projects

**[Massive Graph](https://github.com/econic-ai/massive-graph)** — A real-time graph database designed for collaboration across zero-trust boundaries. Synchronises massive graphs, tensors, and streams between participants who need to share data but cannot fully trust each other. Delta propagation, zero-copy architecture, cryptographic lineage. Target applications include supply chain coordination, research intelligence clusters, and distributed infrastructure networks.

**[Econic Graphs](https://github.com/econic-ai/graphs)** — A 3D graph engine for exploring graph structures at scale. When millions of data points change every second, static dashboards fail — this framework turns complexity into spatial, navigable environments. WebGPU rendering, hierarchical meta-graphs, HTML overlays on 3D positions.

**Intelligence Graphs** — Research into neural graph architectures (GNNs) for intelligent search and knowledge organisation. Dynamic embeddings tuned to the statistical shape of specific knowledge bases, enabling search that understands context beyond keywords.

## Research Interests

- Collaborative neural architectures — part neural networks, part software architecture
- Intelligent markets — where analytical insights become the medium of exchange
- Twin AI systems — decoupling real-time inference from deeper structure-building
- Game theory applied to information collaboration
- Spatial interfaces for human-AI cooperation at massive scale
